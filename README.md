## Outputs

This action does not produce any outputs.

## Vote Types

The action supports four different vote types:

### clear

- **Vote**: Verified=0, Code-Review=0
- **Usage**: Reset/clear existing votes on a change
- **Status Message**: "STARTED"

### success

- **Vote**: Verified=+1
- **Usage**: Mark the change as verified/passing
- **Status Message**: "SUCCESS"

### failure

- **Vote**: Verified=-1
- **Usage**: Mark the change as failing verification
- **Status Message**: "FAILURE"

### cancelled

- **Vote**: Code-Review=+1
- **Usage**: Mark the review as cancelled
- **Status Message**: "CANCELLED"

## Comment Mode

When `comment-only` is `"true"`, the action posts a status comment
without applying votes. This provides informational updates
without affecting the review workflow.

## SSH Configuration

The action requires SSH access to the Gerrit server. You must provide:

1. **SSH Private Key**: Store in GitHub secrets (e.g., `GERRIT_SSH_KEY`)
2. **Known Hosts**: The SSH fingerprint for the Gerrit server
3. **Username**: The Gerrit username for the CI account
4. **Host**: The Gerrit server hostname

The action automatically configures SSH with the provided credentials and
accepts legacy SSH-RSA key types for compatibility with Gerrit servers.

## Implementation Details

The action performs the following steps:

1. **SSH Setup**: Installs the provided SSH key and configures connection
2. **Vote Preparation**: Determines the appropriate vote and status based on
   the `vote-type` input
3. **Gerrit Review**: Executes the `gerrit review` command with:
   - Change and patchset numbers
   - Appropriate vote labels (if not comment mode)
   - Status message with GitHub Actions run URL
   - `autogenerated:github` tag for tracking

## Status Messages

All reviews include a status message linking back to the GitHub Actions run:

```text
{STATUS}: https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}
```

This provides traceability between Gerrit reviews and the CI/CD pipeline that
generated them.

## Notes

- The action skips SSH operations when running in ACT (local testing)
- All reviews include the `autogenerated:github` tag for identification
- The action supports both legacy and modern SSH key types
- Default SSH port 29418 is commonly used by Gerrit servers
